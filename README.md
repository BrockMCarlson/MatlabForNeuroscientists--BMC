# MatlabForNeuroscientists--BMC
 
Hello! This is a repository that I am creating to tackle the practice problems and projects presented in "Matlab For Neuroscientists: An Introduction to Scientific Computing in MATLAB" by Pascal Wallisch, Michael E. Lusignan, Marc D. Benayoun, Tanya I. Baker, Adam S. Dickey, & Nicholas G. Hatsopoulos.
This repository is a work-in-progress, so I apologize for its current disordered state. If you are interested in working with me to clean this up and make it more accessible to new students, please email me! brock.m.carlson@vanderbilt.edu. The ultimate goal is to compile the resources within this repository to create a course to teach computational methods to aspiring neuroscience students.
